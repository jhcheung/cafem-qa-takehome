# QA Engineering Assessment

## Intro
The goal of this assessment is to test a simplistic web app, note any bugs, and document how to reproduce them. Open the index.html page in google chrome for this test. The page will load a script called bundle.min.js, which is intentionally obfuscated. Use the questions below as a guide to what to include in your analysis. Reach out to the hiring manager with any questions.

### Questions
* Describe what bundle.min.js is doing to the page, and try to determine what would happen if the script were not present.
* The button triggers a network request. Review these requests and note any inconsistencies if any. Look for anything notable in the console output
* Does the interface function as described?
* Are there any missing validation rules the code should be following?
* How are styles being applied to the elements on the page?
* Document any steps necessary to reproduce bugs. Include any steps needed to reset the app to its initial state.
* Are there any suggested changes to the code based on the behavior of the script?
